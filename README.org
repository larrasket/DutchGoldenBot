The DutchGoldenBot is a simple go script-like program for managing social media accounts of,
[[https://www.facebook.com/DutchGoldenAge][@DutchGoldenAge]], [[https://twitter.com/DutchGoldenAge_][DutchGoldenAge_]], and [[https://twitter.com/DutchGoldenBot][@DutchGoldenBot]] using Twitter V2 and Facebook
GraphAPI.


* Authentication File

To authenticate you have to maintain a file that contains the following data: facebook
access token, Facebook page id, twitter consumer token, twitter consumer secret and both
twitter access token and access secret for each twitter account. The file structure should
looks like the following:
#+begin_src json
{
  "facebook_token": "",
  "facebook_page_id": "",
  "tw_token": "",
  "tw_sec": "",
  "tw_bot_token": "",
  "tw_bot_sec": "",
  "tw_consum": "",
  "tw_consum_sec": "",
  "twitter_id": ""
}
#+end_src

You can get Facebook tokens easily from [[https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/][Facebook Graph Explorer Tool]], and it have to have
the following permissions: ~pages_show_list~, ~pages_messaging~, ~pages_read_engagement~,
~pages_read_user_content~, ~pages_manage_posts~ and ~pages_manage_engagement~. *Please note*
that [[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/pages_manage_posts/][some]] of these permissions may require business verifications.

Also note that all of Facebook access token has an expire date by default, so you have
to keep that in mind.

For twitter's, it works for life-time unless the user unauthenticates it themselves. To get
user's access token, you can use [[https://gist.github.com/salehmu/8258039d52efb7958e7e5edad2f2fcd7][dghubble/oauth1]].
* Usage
Have a loot at [[file:post][the example post]], maintain a file with the same format with the same file
name, run the program in the very same directory. And that's it. (the KISS principle)
